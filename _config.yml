  Hi, my name's Aaron and I'm a senior software engineer. I have experience in a multitude of areas with my most recent endeavor being web development. I have extensive experience in computer vision having done research and development during my tenure at UCLA and NeuralX. Coming from a Mathematics background, I am analytical and love to solve difficult problems in innovative, elegant, and simple ways. Having been a Jiu-Jitsu teacher for several years of my life I love to share what I know and constantly seek to better those around me. When I am not coding or reading something software related, I typically am spending quality time with my wife and dog (Miu Miu).

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Overwatch</mark>

            During my time at LinQuest I have cultivated a love for web development having prior known very little at all. Initially coming in as a frontend developer working on their <mark>Angular</mark> application, I quickly transitioned into backend development in <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, and <mark>Go</mark> to assist across the teams. Within in 6 months, I was comfortable in all areas of our DevOps pipeline being able to assist in bash scripting for the toolchain and platform team, develop robust and accurate REST services for the backend team, and even tackle the occasional frontend bug we may have. Throughout my time I have used various frameworks such as Pyramid, Spring, Tornado, Angular, Gorilla, and more and feel comfortable jumping into any environment regardless of the tech stack.

            I was fortunate enough to be trusted with more responsibility and began crafting our architecture and standardizing practices across internal and external teams. I tackled several large problems during my tenure at LinQuest including increasing the maintainability of our CI/CD pipeline by refactoring base workflows into plugin based Github reusable workflows and github-actions to be reused across reusable workflows. This transition improved realiability of the CI/CD pipeline for all teams by providing a customizable, extendable, and easily fixable approach to building, scanning, and deploying applications. In addition to the above, I crafted a <mark>Websocket</mark> service and messaging scheme between server and clients to provide real-time domain updates, centralized our alerting system and interface to data brokers to reduce coupling. Laslty, I reevaluated previous architecture solutions and provided simpler alternatives such as combining microservices when their coupling was too tight.

            I also became familiar with our platform tools and services, such as <mark>Kafka</mark>, <mark>Prometheus</mark>, <mark>Grafana</mark>, <mark>LinkerD</mark>, and <mark>Kubernetes (EKS)</mark>, that were the backbone of our DevOps cycle. We faced several growing pains with <mark>Kafka</mark> that reduced our ability to scale consumers. The issue stemmed from large events forcing consumers to constantly rebalance and was resolved by minimizing size of events pushed to topics and ensuring consumer settings were optimized for longer running algorithms. This fix lead to an increase in scalability by at least 400% (3 pods to 12 pods but did not test beyond that) and removed a common infinite kafka rebalancing error in our consumers.<mark>Prometheus</mark>, <mark>Grafana</mark> were essential in tracking down the troubled services and determining whne the issues occured.

            LinQuest provided me the tools to keep calm and persevere under strenuous conditions. I Deployed and debugged our application with over 30 micro-services on an IL6 staging environment with basic tools (OOTB shell) and no external resources (A.K.A The Dungeon). Our application used a Blue/Green deployment  which ensured minimal downtime and disruption for our users. I am comfortable with identifying and resolving various platform and software issues including, but not limited to, malformed or incorrect client and CA certificates (m/TLS with external applications), <mark>Postgres</mark> and <mark>MongoDB</mark> database configuration and storage, <mark>Kustomize</mark> configuration, misalignment in service versions, and <mark>Kafka</mark> broker storage and networking under these conditions. Considering the lack of resources in the high-side environment I provided extensive documentation on the deployment folder structure,  process, helper scripts for common actions, common issue resolutions to save anyone else from suffering. I believe this makes me highly capable in any environment regardless of the work conditions.

            NeuralX provided me with an opportunity to apply my skills from UCLA in a professional working environment. I quickly adapted into the fast pace startup culture having to independently develop, train, and evaluated network models, including ResNet-101, LIP-JPP Net, FPN + Faster R-CNN, to build a complete fashion classification, detection, and segmentation pipeline that identifies color, type, and patterns of clothing in images.

            I developed and maintained the <mark>ETL</mark> pipeline in <mark>C</mark> (I felt it was simpler than <mark>C++</mark> and felt more comfortable with <mark>C</mark> overall.) to maximize performance of the transform portion while using <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Bash</mark> to perform data extraction and loading. Images would be uploaded to an <mark>S3 Bucket</mark> alongside some metadata in <mark>MongoDB</mark> for easy fetching. The pipeline acheived 50x amount of images on average versus an initial implementation done in <mark>Python</mark> solely allowing me to run our pipeline on a single machine with minimal costs overall.

            To ensure reliable, consistent, and easily testable changes to our datasets I developed an MLOps pipeline using <mark>CircleCI</mark> and <mark>Docker</mark> to simplify the tedious data harvesting, training, evaluation, and deployment of our fashion detection application. In addition to our ML pipeline I developed pipelines to and publish libraries into <mark>Nexus</mark> to use across different parts of the pipeline. I also included data visualization libraries such as <mark>Matplotlib</mark> to visualize pipeline data collected in a digestable fashion for our clients.

            In addition to the Machine Learning aspect, I helped a small team of developers build a website to visualize the results of our pipeline in various forms including graphs, image catalogs, and reports. I participated in frontend and backend development comprised of a <mark>React</mark> application deployed on <mark>AWS</mark> as an EC2 instance using <mark>Nginx</mark> and a <mark>Spring Boot</mark> service to provide collected data analytics and images.

          During my time at UCLA, I took many courses related to Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning including several graduate level courses. In my free time I would assist in research and spent time in several labs including the Human Perception Laboratory, Computer Vision Lab, and the VCLA Lab.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
