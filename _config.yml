  Hi, my name's Aaron and I'm a senior software engineer. I have experience in a multitude of areas with my most recent passion being web application development and architecture. I previously worked in the computer vision field having done research and development during my tenure at UCLA in the Computer Vision Lab and NeuralX. Coming from a Mathematics background, I am analytical and love to solve difficult problems in innovative, elegant, and simple ways. Having been a Jiu-Jitsu instructor for several years, I love to share what I know and constantly seek to better those around me. When I am not coding or reading something software development related, I typically am spending quality time with my wife and dog (Miu Miu).

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Overwatch 2</mark>

            During my time at LinQuest, I have cultivated a passion for web development. Initially coming in as a developer working on their <mark>Angular</mark> application, I quickly transitioned into backend development in <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, and <mark>Go</mark> to assist across the teams. Within 6 months, I was comfortable in all areas of our application stack from generating scripts for our <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipeline, developing <mark>RESTful</mark> services, and tackling user facing bugs and challenges on the frontend. Throughout my time I have used various frameworks and toolkits such as <mark>Pyramid</mark>, <mark>Spring</mark>, <mark>Tornado</mark>, <mark>Gorilla</mark> and more, and feel confident developing regardless of the tech stack.

            I was fortunate enough to be trusted with more responsibility and began crafting our architecture and standardizing practices across internal and external teams. I tackled several large problems during my tenure at LinQuest including increasing the maintainability of our Github <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipeline by refactoring base workflows into plugin based Github reusable workflows and github-actions to be reused across reusable workflows. This transition improved the reliability of the <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipeline for all teams by providing a customizable, extendable, and easily fixable approach to building, scanning, and deploying applications. In addition to the above, I crafted a <mark>Websocket</mark> service and messaging scheme between server and clients to provide real-time domain updates, centralized our alerting system and interface to data brokers to reduce coupling. Lastly, I re-evaluated previous architecture solutions and established simpler alternatives such as combining tightly coupled microservices or removing unused ones.

            I also became familiar with our platform tools and services, such as <mark>Kafka</mark>, <mark>Prometheus</mark>, <mark>Grafana</mark>, <mark>LinkerD</mark>, and <mark>Kubernetes (EKS)</mark>, that were the backbone of our DevOps cycle. We faced several growing pains with <mark>Kafka</mark> that reduced our ability to scale consumers. The issue stemmed from large events forcing consumers to miss crucial check-ins with the <mark>Kafka</mark> broker causing an infinite rebalance as more consumers tried to join the group. This was resolved by minimizing the size of events pushed to topics and ensuring consumer settings were optimized for longer running algorithms. This fix led to an increase in scalability by at least 400% (3 pods to 12 pods but did not test beyond that) and removed a common infinite <mark>Kafka</mark> rebalancing error in our consumers.<mark>Prometheus</mark>, <mark>Grafana</mark> were essential in tracking down the troubled services and determining when the issues occurred.

            LinQuest provided me with the tools to keep calm and persevere under strenuous conditions. I deployed and debugged our application with over 30 micro-services on an IL6 staging environment with basic tools (minimal terminal) and no external resources (A.K.A The Dungeon). Our application used a Blue/Green deployment which ensured minimal downtime and disruption for our users. I am comfortable with identifying and resolving various platform and software issues including, but not limited to, malformed or incorrect client and CA certificates (m/TLS with external applications), <mark>Postgres</mark> and <mark>MongoDB</mark> database configuration and storage, <mark>Kustomize</mark> configuration, misalignment in service versions, and <mark>Kafka</mark> broker storage and networking under these conditions. Considering the lack of resources in the high-side environment I provided extensive documentation on the deployment folder structure, process, helper scripts for common actions, and common issue resolutions to save anyone else from suffering. I believe this makes me highly capable in any environment regardless of work conditions.

            NeuralX provided me with an opportunity to apply my skills from UCLA in a professional working environment. I quickly adapted into the fast pace startup culture having to independently develop or modify, preprocess data, train, and evaluate deep learning models, including ResNet-101, LIP-JPP Net, FPN + Faster R-CNN, to build a complete fashion classification, detection, and segmentation pipeline that identifies color, type, and patterns of clothing in images.

            I developed and maintained the <mark>ETL</mark> pipeline in <mark>C</mark> (I felt it was simpler than <mark>C++</mark> and felt more comfortable with <mark>C</mark> overall.) to maximize performance of the transform portion while using <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Bash</mark> to perform data extraction and loading. Images would be uploaded to an <mark>S3 Bucket</mark> alongside some metadata in <mark>MongoDB</mark> for easy fetching. The pipeline acheived 50x amount of images on average versus an initial implementation done in <mark>Python</mark> solely allowing me to run our pipeline on a single machine with minimal costs overall.

            To ensure reliable, consistent, and easily testable changes to our datasets I developed an MLOps pipeline using <mark>CircleCI</mark> and <mark>Docker</mark> to simplify the tedious data harvesting, training, evaluation, and deployment of our fashion detection application. In addition to our ML pipeline I developed pipelines to and publish libraries into <mark>Nexus</mark> to use across different parts of the pipeline. I also included data visualization libraries such as <mark>Matplotlib</mark> to visualize pipeline data collected in a digestable fashion for our clients.

            In addition to the Machine Learning aspect, I helped a small team of developers build a website to visualize the results of our pipeline in various forms including graphs, image catalogs, and reports. I participated in frontend and backend development comprised of a <mark>React</mark> application deployed on <mark>AWS</mark> as an EC2 instance using <mark>Nginx</mark> and a <mark>Spring Boot</mark> service to provide collected data analytics and images.

            I participated in researching a novel dropout method largely influenced by Hebbian Learning to provide a regularization method that increased neural network model robustness by 8% on average across datasets. I created a simple pipeline in <mark>Python</mark> to allow users to train and test our model for reproducible results. To enable participation and collaboration from more members of the lab, I packaged this pipeline in <mark>Docker</mark> as a Jupyter Notebook file to provide a simpler UI to interact with. I provided documentation and unit testing for reliability various portions of our pipeline. Collaborated with post docs to analyze algorithmic complexity and implementation of custom packages/software.

            In addition to development, I maintained the single Ubuntu machine and user accounts in the lab running routine updates and ensuring the necessary packages were installed to perform the various lab memebers work.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
