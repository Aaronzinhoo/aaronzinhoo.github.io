  Hi, my name's Aaron and I'm a senior software engineer. I have experience in a multitude of areas with my most recent passion being web application development and architecture. I previously worked in the computer vision field having done research and development during my tenure at UCLA in the Computational Vision and Learning Lab and NeuralX. Coming from a Mathematics background, I am analytical and love to solve difficult problems in innovative, elegant, and simple ways. Having been a Jiu-Jitsu instructor for several years, I love to share what I know and constantly seek to better those around me. When I am not coding or reading something software development related, I typically spend quality time with my wife and our dog (Miu Miu).

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Overwatch 2</mark>

            During my time at LinQuest, I have cultivated a passion for web development. Initially coming in as a developer working on their <mark>Angular</mark> application, I quickly transitioned into backend development in <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, and <mark>Go</mark> to assist across the teams. Within 6 months, I was comfortable in all areas of our application stack from generating scripts for our <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipeline, developing <mark>RESTful</mark> services, and tackling user facing bugs and challenges on the frontend. Throughout my time I have used various frameworks and toolkits such as <mark>Pyramid</mark>, <mark>Spring</mark>, <mark>Tornado</mark>, <mark>Gorilla</mark> and more, and feel confident developing regardless of the tech stack.

            I was fortunate enough to be trusted with more responsibility and began crafting our architecture and standardizing practices across internal and external teams. I tackled several large problems during my tenure at LinQuest including increasing the maintainability of our Github <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipeline by refactoring base workflows into plugin based Github reusable workflows and github-actions to be reused across reusable workflows. This transition improved the reliability of the <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipeline for all teams by providing a customizable, extendable, and easily fixable approach to building, scanning, and deploying applications. In addition to the above, I crafted a <mark>Websocket</mark> service and messaging scheme between server and clients to provide real-time domain updates, centralized our alerting system and interface to data brokers to reduce coupling. Lastly, I re-evaluated previous architecture solutions and established simpler alternatives such as combining tightly coupled microservices or removing unused ones.

            I also became adpet with utilizing, and at times troubleshooting, our platform tools and services, such as <mark>Kafka</mark>, <mark>Prometheus</mark>, <mark>Grafana</mark>, <mark>LinkerD</mark>, and <mark>Kubernetes (EKS)</mark>. We faced several growing pains with <mark>Kafka</mark> that reduced our ability to scale consumers initially. The issue stemmed from large events forcing consumers to miss crucial check-ins with the <mark>Kafka</mark> broker causing an infinite rebalance as more consumers tried to join the group. This was resolved by minimizing the size of events pushed to topics and ensuring consumer settings were optimized for longer running algorithms. This fix led to an increase in scalability by at least 400% (3 pods to 12 pods but did not test beyond that) and removed a common infinite <mark>Kafka</mark> rebalancing error in our consumers.<mark>Prometheus</mark>, <mark>Grafana</mark> were essential in tracking down the troubled services and determining when the issues occurred.

            I deployed and debugged our application with over 30 micro-services, from internal and external teams, on an IL6 staging environment with basic tools (minimal terminal) and no external resources. Our application used a Blue/Green deployment which ensured minimal downtime and disruption to our users while enabling us to a simple recovery path. During deployments I had plenty of experiences debugging malformed or incorrect client, server, and CA certificates, incorrect platform (<mark>Postgres</mark>, <mark>Kustomize</mark>, <mark>MongoDB</mark>, and <mark>Kafka</mark>) configuration, storage issues, and troubleshooting networking issues for on-prem and cloud servers and within <mark>Kubernetes</mark> clusters. Every issue encountered was documented and patched in a following release. I also documentated the deployment folder structure, process, helper scripts for common actions, and common issue resolutions to save anyone else from suffering. This experience has instilled confidence in my ability to perform under pressure in any tech stack.

            NeuralX provided me with an opportunity to apply my skills from UCLA in a professional working environment. I quickly adapted into the fast pace startup culture having to independently preprocess data, modify, train, and evaluate deep learning models, including ResNet-101, LIP-JPP Net, FPN + Faster R-CNN, to build a complete fashion classification, detection, and segmentation pipeline that identifies color, type, and patterns of clothing in images.

            Training certain models to detect patterns was especially hard considering patterns like flowers, dots, and cheetah patterns which are relatively similar to machines. Expanding upon my research from the CVL Lab, I was able to develop a novel augmentation algorithm generating synthetic images that captured common traits of pictures in the wild while emphasizing the differences between the patterns mentioned above. This augmentation algorithm along with soft labels increased our pattern model accuracy by ~20% on average.

            I developed and maintained the <mark>ETL</mark> pipeline in <mark>C</mark> to maximize performance of the transform portion while using <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Bash</mark> to perform data extraction and loading. Images would be uploaded to an <mark>S3 Bucket</mark> alongside some metadata in <mark>MongoDB</mark> for easy fetching. The pipeline acheived 50x amount of images on average versus an initial implementation done in <mark>Python</mark> solely allowing me to run our pipeline on a single machine with minimal costs overall.

            To ensure reliable, consistent, and easily testable changes to our datasets, I developed an MLOps pipeline using <mark>CircleCI</mark> and <mark>Docker</mark> to simplify the tedious data harvesting, training, evaluation, and deployment of our fashion detection application. In addition to our ML pipeline, I developed pipelines to and publish libraries into <mark>Nexus</mark> to use across different parts of the pipeline. I also included data visualization libraries such as <mark>Matplotlib</mark> to visualize pipeline data collected in a digestable fashion for our clients.

            In addition to the Machine Learning development, I led a small team of developers to build a website to visualize the results of our pipeline including graphs, image catalogs, and reports. I participated in frontend comprised of a <mark>React</mark> application deployed on <mark>AWS</mark> as an EC2 instance using <mark>Nginx</mark>. I also helped establish a <mark>Spring Boot</mark> service alongside <mark>MongoDB</mark> to provide collected metadata, analytics, and images.

            I participated in researching a novel dropout method largely influenced by Hebbian Learning to provide a regularization method that increased neural network model robustness by 8% on average across datasets. I created a simple pipeline in <mark>Python</mark> to allow users to train and test our model for reproducible results. To enable participation and collaboration from more members of the lab, I packaged this pipeline as a Jupyter Notebook within a <mark>Docker</mark> image to provide a simpler UI to interact with. I provided documentation and unit testing for establishing baseline functionality for various portions of our pipeline.

            In addition to development, I maintained the single Ubuntu machine and user accounts in the lab running routine updates and ensuring the necessary packages were installed to perform the various lab memebers work.
